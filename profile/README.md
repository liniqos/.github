# LiniqOS

**The Unix of the Cloud — Unified, Intelligent, Portable.**

LiniqOS is an open, intelligent interface layer for modern cloud infrastructure. It abstracts the underlying complexity of multiple cloud providers, orchestrators, and runtimes into a seamless, programmable system — enabling developers and teams to focus on *what* they want to run, not *how* it runs.

## 🚀 Why LiniqOS?

Today's cloud ecosystem is fragmented — every provider has its own primitives, pricing models, APIs, and quirks. LiniqOS exists to unify that.

- ⚙️ **Unified Abstraction:** One interface to rule compute, network, and storage across any provider.
- 🤖 **Intelligent Orchestration:** Smart scheduling, cost-awareness, and policy-driven provisioning.
- 🔐 **Built-In Security:** Enforced best practices at the core — key rotation, network isolation, secrets management.
- 📦 **Composable Architecture:** Build your stack modularly — bring your infra, plug in your logic.
- 🌐 **Cloud-Agnostic:** AWS, GCP, Azure, Hetzner, Akash, OCI — no lock-in, no problem.

## 🔍 Example Use Cases

- Deploy a containerized app to the cheapest region across providers, intelligently.
- Migrate workloads between clouds without rewriting infrastructure code.
- Manage multi-cloud environments through a single secure control plane.
- Integrate with CI/CD systems and optimize workloads in real time.
